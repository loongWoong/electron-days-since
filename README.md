# electron-days-since

A simple and easy-to-use desktop application that calculates the number of days between July 16th, 2017, and the current date, displaying the result in years, months, and days.  This application combines the date calculation capabilities of Python with the cross-platform desktop application development capabilities of Electron, providing an intuitive user interface.

## Background

In life, we often need to calculate how many days have passed since a specific date. To meet this need, I developed `electron-days-since`. This program uses a Python script for date calculations and is packaged into a user-friendly desktop application using Electron, allowing users to easily view the date difference at any time.

## Features

* Calculates and displays the total number of days from July 16th, 2017, to the current date.
* Converts the number of days into a year, month, and day format for easier user understanding.
* Provides a simple and intuitive user interface that is easy to operate.
* Supports .exe packaging for Windows platforms for convenient user execution.

## Tech Stack

* **Python:** Used for date calculations and logic processing.
* **Electron:** Used to build cross-platform desktop applications.
* **Node.js:** Version 18.20.4 used as the Electron runtime environment.
* **Yarn:** Version 1.22.22 used for running the project and building the .exe file.

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Installing the .exe

1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract the archive and run `days_since.exe`.
3. View the days since July 16th, 2017.

### 2. Building from Source

#### 2.1 Running
```bash
#use yarn
yarn start
#or use npm
npm start
```

#### 2.2 Building the .exe Installer
```bash
#use yarn
yarn run build
#or use npm
npm run build
```

## Special Notes:

When running `yarn run build`, the error `тип Get "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder-binaries/releases/download/winCodeSign-2.6.0/winCodeSign-2.6.0.7z":` occurred. Therefore, I downloaded it locally and configured it in `electron-builder.yml`. You can modify the path `G:\toos\winCodeSign-2.6.0` according to your actual path.
